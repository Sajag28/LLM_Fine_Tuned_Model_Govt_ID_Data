# LLM_Fine_Tuned_Model_Govt_ID_Data
Government Data Classification with DistilBERT Fine-Tuning
This project leverages the power of DistilBERT, a smaller and faster variant of BERT from the Transformers library, to perform fine-tuned classification on a custom government dataset.

Objective:

The goal is to classify data points based on a specific state within the dataset. If the data associated with that state falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 5000 in this case), the model predicts 0; otherwise, it predicts 1. This binary classification aims to identify potential areas of interest based on data volume variation.

Technical Approach:

Data Preparation:
Preprocess and clean the custom government dataset, ensuring consistent formatting and addressing missing values.
Create numerical representations of textual data using appropriate techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Split the data into training, validation, and test sets for robust model evaluation.
Fine-tuning DistilBERT:
Load the pre-trained DistilBERT model from the Transformers library.
Adapt the model to the specific task by adding a classifier layer on top of the pre-trained layers.
Train the model using the prepared training set and optimize hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, epochs) for optimal performance.
Monitor training progress and performance metrics like accuracy and loss on the validation set to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation and Analysis:
Evaluate the fine-tuned model on the unseen test set to assess its generalization ability.
Analyze the model's performance through confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and other relevant metrics.
Interpret the model's behavior by investigating feature importance and potential biases.
LLM Fine-Tuning:

This project specifically utilizes "LLM Fine-Tuning", a technique involving transferring knowledge from a pre-trained large language model (LLM) like DistilBERT to a new, smaller model designed for the specific classification task. This approach benefits from the pre-trained knowledge while maintaining computational efficiency.
